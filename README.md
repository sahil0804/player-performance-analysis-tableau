# player-performance-analysis-tableau
This project analyses the performance of forward players using interactive Tableau dashboards. The aim is to compare players based on scoring output, physical attributes, and consistency across multiple seasons to support selection and performance review decisions.

**Business Context**

Player selection and performance management require more than just recent match statistics. By analysing historical trends and physical characteristics, coaching and analytics teams can better understand long-term performance patterns and identify players with consistent contributions.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes player-level match statistics and physical attributes such as:

- Goals, assists, and marks by season

- Player age

- Height and weight

- Team information

The data was prepared and analysed within Tableau for trend-based and comparative analysis.

**Tools and Techniques**

- Tableau Desktop
  
- Calculated fields
  
- Interactive filters (team and age)
  
- Multi-metric trend visualisation
  
All visualisations were built directly in Tableau.

**Dashboard Structure**

The dashboard includes the following views:

- Top forward players ranked by average goals
  
- Relationship between height, weight, and age for top performers
  
- Year-wise performance trends for goals, assists, and marks
  
- Team and age filters for focused comparison
  
These views allow comparison across players and seasons in a single interactive interface.

**Observations**

Some general patterns observed from the dashboard:

- Certain players maintain consistently high scoring output across seasons.
  
- Physical attributes such as height and weight vary among top performers, suggesting multiple successful player profiles.
  
- Performance trends help distinguish consistent contributors from players with fluctuating form.
  
These insights support performance review and selection discussions rather than acting as predictive indicators.

**How This Can Be Used**

The dashboard can assist coaching and analysis teams by:
Supporting player selection discussions
Identifying consistent performers over multiple seasons
Comparing physical and performance profiles across teams

**How to View the Dashboard**

Download the .twbx file from the tableau-workbook folder.
Open it using Tableau Desktop or the free Tableau Reader application.
